# Real Capita Accounting & Project Finance System Handoff

## Current Phase

Phase 2A: accounting foundation frontend implementation complete through Chunk 3B.

Phase 0 is complete and accepted. Phase 1A delivered the secure login, the single confirmed Accountant role, the protected app shell, agent documentation, ADRs, and verification scripts. Phase 1B locked the accounting foundation requirements and acceptance criteria.

Phase 2A was implemented in chunks:

- Chunk 1: accounting-foundation Prisma schema, migration, and the fixed five-class `AccountClass` system seed - complete.
- Chunk 2: backend accounting foundation API guarded by the `ACCOUNTANT` role - complete, reviewed, pushed, and accepted.
- Chunk 3A: frontend accounting foundation pages - complete.
- Chunk 3B: remaining frontend pages and final integration verification - complete.

## Phase 2A Chunk 3B (remaining frontend foundation) - completed this session

- Reused the partial Chunk 3B frontend work already in progress: the shared `Select` primitive, expanded typed API helpers, and active navigation links for the remaining accounting foundation pages.
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/accounting-periods/page.tsx`: list, create, and edit accounting periods under fiscal years with OPEN, LOCKED, and CLOSED status.
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/cost-centers/page.tsx`: list, create, edit, and deactivate cost centers under projects.
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/accounts/groups/page.tsx`: list, create, edit, and deactivate account groups under fixed account classes.
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/accounts/ledger/page.tsx`: list, create, edit, and deactivate ledger accounts with normal balance, project/cost-center requirement flags, and Cash/Bank eligibility.
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/cash-bank/page.tsx`: list, create, edit, and deactivate cash/bank accounts linked only to ledger accounts marked as Cash/Bank.
- Phase 2A accounting foundation frontend is now implemented.
- No Prisma schema changes, migrations, backend changes, roles, business seed data, file uploads, vouchers, reports, dashboard analytics, payroll, parties, customers, or vendors were added in Chunk 3B.

## Phase 2A Chunk 3A (frontend foundation) - completed

- Extended `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` into a typed, cookie-authenticated API helper: `apiFetch` always sends `credentials: "include"`, surfaces clear auth/connection errors through an `ApiError` type, and never stores tokens in `localStorage`. Added resource helpers and types for company, fiscal years, projects, and account classes.
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/_components/ui.tsx` shared presentation primitives (cards, fields, buttons, status badges, notices) for a calm, professional accountant UI.
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/layout.tsx`: a protected app shell that gates on `GET /auth/me`, shows the signed-in user and role, provides sign out, and renders real navigation.
- Reworked `apps/web/src/app/app/page.tsx` into a calm overview/landing page with quick links (no analytics, no charts).
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/company/page.tsx`: create or edit the singleton company profile (name, legalName, address, phone, email, currency default BDT).
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/fiscal-years/page.tsx`: list, create, edit, and activate fiscal years with active/closed status; uses the singleton company id for creation.
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/projects/page.tsx`: list, create, and edit projects (code, name, location, notes, isActive).
- Added `apps/web/src/app/app/accounts/classes/page.tsx`: read-only Account Classes table (code, name, normalBalance).
- No Prisma schema changes, no migrations, and no backend changes were made in Chunk 3A.
