# Start Here

This file is the first stop for any AI agent or developer continuing the Real Capita Accounting & Project Finance System.

## Current Status

Phase 0 is complete and accepted. Phase 1A adds multi-agent continuity plus single-accountant authentication.

Phase 1A is implemented in this repository.

Phase 1B documentation/specification lock is prepared. It does not implement business modules.

The only confirmed role is `ACCOUNTANT`, displayed as `Accountant`. It represents AGM sir as the main accounting operator for now. Do not add other roles until Real Capita confirms exact responsibilities.

## Where To Look First

1. `AGENTS.md` for project rules and strict boundaries.
2. `docs/ai/CURRENT_STATE.md` for implemented and non-implemented scope.
3. `docs/ai/WORKFLOW.md` for safe agent workflow.
4. `docs/handoff.md` for the latest project handoff.
5. `prisma/schema.prisma` for the current database model.
6. `apps/api/src` and `apps/web/src` for implementation.
7. `docs/requirements/phase-1b-accounting-foundation-lock.md` before any business-module coding.
8. `docs/prompts/droid-cli-next-prompt.md` if continuing in Droid CLI or another agent after Codex limit.

## Local Setup

```powershell
cd D:\real-capita-accounts
git pull --ff-only
git status --short --branch
pnpm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
docker compose up -d postgres
pnpm prisma:generate
pnpm prisma:migrate
pnpm seed
```

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm check:all
pnpm doctor
```

Manual auth verification:

- Start the API with `pnpm dev:api`.
- Start the web app with `pnpm dev:web`.
- Visit `/login`.
- Sign in with `accountant@realcapita.local` and `ChangeMe123!`.
- Confirm `/app` shows the user and the Accountant role.

## If Previous AI Context Was Lost

Do not rely on hidden chat memory. Reconstruct state from this repo:

1. Run `pnpm agent:start`.
2. Read `docs/ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`.
3. Check `git log --oneline --max-count=8`.
4. Check `git status --short --branch`.
5. Continue only from documented requirements.

If continuing after Codex limit in Droid CLI, GLM, DeepSeek, Opus, Gemini, or another tool, read `docs/prompts/droid-cli-next-prompt.md` before coding.
