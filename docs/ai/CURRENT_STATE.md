# Current State

## Completed Phase

Phase 0 is complete and accepted.

Phase 1A is implemented: multi-agent project continuity plus single-accountant authentication.

Phase 1B requirement/specification lock is complete.

Phase 2A accounting foundation frontend is implemented through Chunk 3B:

- Chunk 1 (Prisma schema, migration, system `AccountClass` seed) is complete.
- Chunk 2 (backend accounting foundation API) is complete, reviewed, and accepted.
- Chunk 3A (frontend accounting foundation pages) is complete.
- Chunk 3B (remaining frontend pages and final integration verification) is complete.

## Implemented Features

- pnpm workspace monorepo.
- Next.js App Router frontend.
- NestJS API.
- Prisma ORM.
- PostgreSQL 17 through Docker Compose.
- API health endpoint at `GET /health`.
- PostgreSQL host-port isolation on `localhost:55432`.
- Phase 0 documentation and handoff.
- Phase 1A documentation, ADRs, scripts, and auth foundation.
- Phase 1B requirement/spec lock documents for the accounting foundation implementation.
- Phase 2A Chunk 1: accounting-foundation Prisma models (`Company`, `FiscalYear`, `AccountingPeriod`, `Project`, `CostCenter`, `AccountClass`, `AccountGroup`, `LedgerAccount`, `CashBankAccount`) and a fixed five-class `AccountClass` system seed.
- Phase 2A Chunk 2: backend accounting foundation API guarded by the `ACCOUNTANT` role - `/company`, `/fiscal-years` (+ `/:id/activate`), `/accounting-periods`, `/projects`, `/cost-centers`, `/account-classes`, `/account-groups`, `/ledger-accounts`, `/cash-bank-accounts`.
- Phase 2A Chunk 3A frontend foundation:
  - Typed, cookie-authenticated API helper (`apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`) using `credentials: "include"`, an `ApiError` type with clear auth/connection messages, and no token storage in `localStorage`.
  - Protected `/app` shell layout with real navigation.
  - `/app/company` Company Setup page (create or edit the singleton company profile).
  - `/app/fiscal-years` Fiscal Years page (list, create, edit, activate, with active/closed status).
  - `/app/projects` Projects page (list, create, edit).
  - `/app/accounts/classes` read-only Account Classes page.
- Phase 2A Chunk 3B frontend foundation:
  - `/app/accounting-periods` Accounting Periods page (list, create, edit; fiscal-year dropdown; OPEN/LOCKED/CLOSED status).
  - `/app/cost-centers` Cost Centers page (list, create, edit/deactivate; project dropdown).
  - `/app/accounts/groups` Account Groups page (list, create, edit/deactivate; account-class dropdown).
  - `/app/accounts/ledger` Ledger Accounts page (list, create, edit/deactivate; normal balance and requirement flags).
  - `/app/cash-bank` Cash & Bank page (list, create, edit/deactivate; only ledger accounts marked Cash/Bank are selectable).
  - The Phase 2A accounting foundation frontend is now implemented.

## Confirmed Role Model

Only one role is confirmed now:

- `ACCOUNTANT`, displayed as `Accountant`

Future roles are to be confirmed later. They are not implemented, seeded, displayed, or modeled.

## Current Non-Features

The repo intentionally does not include vouchers, journals, ledger reports, cash book, bank book, trial balance, financial statements, reports, payroll, salary sheets, project finance reports, parties, customers, vendors, dashboard analytics, file uploads, ERP modules, business seed data, or unconfirmed office roles.

The Phase 2A accounting foundation frontend is implemented, but transaction workflows and reporting are still intentionally outside scope.

## Database Port

Host tools must connect to PostgreSQL at `localhost:55432`.

Docker maps host `55432` to container `5432`.

## Local Port Caveats

The default web port is `3000`. If it is occupied, run the web app on `3010` and start the API with `WEB_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3010`.

The default API port is `4000`.

## Next Recommended Task

The next task should be a focused review/acceptance pass for Phase 2A Chunk 3B, then a separate user-confirmed plan for any future phase.

Reference docs before continuing:

- `docs/requirements/phase-1b-accounting-foundation-lock.md`
- `docs/architecture/phase-1b-accounting-foundation-model-proposal.md`
- `docs/acceptance/phase-1b-acceptance-criteria.md`

Do not start vouchers, reports, dashboard analytics, payroll, parties/customers/vendors, additional roles, file uploads, or business seed data without explicit user approval for a new phase.
